I am a Doctoral Assistant in [Data-Intensive Application and Systems (DIAS) Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/dias/){:target="\_blank"} of [School of Computer and Communication Sciences, EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/){:target="\_blank"}, supervised by [Prof. Anastasia Ailamaki](https://people.epfl.ch/anastasia.ailamaki?lang=en){:target="\_blank"}.  

My research is in the area of __*data management systems*__, focusing on high-performance, scalable and adaptive database system designs running complex __*hybrid transactional/analytical processing (HTAP)*__ workloads, and __*modern hardware*__ such as GPUs for query acceleration, SmartSSDs for near-data processing, SmartNICs to enable in-line data aggregation and routing.

My vision is to enable truly scalable data processing while taming heterogeneities in workload, data and underlying hardware infrastructure through __*just-in-time (JIT) engines*__ and provide runtime adaptivity and tight performance bounds.

<!-- Before joining BU I was a Research Associate at Harvard University. From 2014-2017 I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at Harvard University in the Data Systems Lab with Stratos Idreos, where I was supported by a SNSF Postdoc Mobility Fellowship. I received my PhD (2014) from EPFL, where I worked in the Data-Intensive Applications and Systems Lab on studying data systems architectures for analytics exploiting new storage hardware with Anastasia Ailamaki. I obtained my MSc (2008) in Computer Systems Technology, and BSc (2005) in Informatics and Telecommunications from the University of Athens, Greece. I have also been at IBM Research as a PhD Intern in 2011, and a junior researcher in the University of Athens and the National Technical University of Athens. -->


I can speak/write/listen in English (fluent), French (beginner), Urdu (mother tongue) and C++. 


Outside of the office I enjoy travelling and driving across cities.





<!-- I obtained my bachelors of sciences in computer science from School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (SEECS) in National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) in Islamabad, Pakistan.  -->


<!-- National doctorate of engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, whereas before joining DIAS, I spent sixteen months at the University of Catania where I worked on the Internet of Things. -->
<!-- My current research aims in enabling fast and predictable data management systems. To achieve this, I separate query execution from resource scheduling and I optimise the first for speed and the second for providing adaptivity and tight performance bounds. My vision is to enable query execution at extreme scale over todayâ€™s heterogeneous network infrastructure. -->

<!-- During my academic career I have spent time at University of Athens, Greece (B.Sc.) and EPFL, Switzerland (M.Sc., Ph.D.). Professionally, I have been employed by Microsoft, Microsoft Research, Credit Suisse, and Nexthink. I am the recipient of an EPFL PhD Fellowship and an EPFL teaching excellence award.  -->
