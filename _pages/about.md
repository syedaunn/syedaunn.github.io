<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


I am a Doctoral Assistant in [Data-Intensive Application and Systems (DIAS) Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/dias/){:target="\_blank"} of [School of Computer and Communication Sciences, EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/){:target="\_blank"}, supervised by [Prof. Anastasia Ailamaki](https://people.epfl.ch/anastasia.ailamaki?lang=en){:target="\_blank"}.  

My research is in the area of __*data management systems*__, focusing on high-performance, scalable and adaptive database system designs running complex __*hybrid transactional/analytical processing (HTAP)*__ workloads, and __*modern hardware*__ such as GPUs for query acceleration, SmartSSDs for near-data processing, SmartNICs to enable in-line data aggregation and routing.

My vision is to enable truly scalable data processing while taming heterogeneities in workload, data and underlying hardware infrastructure through __*just-in-time (JIT) engines*__ and provide runtime adaptivity and tight performance bounds.


I can speak/write/listen in English (fluent), French (beginner), Urdu (mother tongue) and C++. 


Outside of the office I enjoy travelling and driving across cities.
